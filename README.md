  This project aims to classify human activities using data obtained from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors from phone and watch. The raw data will be preprocessed using two
  different approaches such as topological data analysis and statistical features extraction from segmented time series. The goal is to compare and evaluate the performance of
  different classifiers (Decision Tree, k Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, SVM and CNN) which are trained on the two sets of preprocessed data.

  The WISDM (Wireless Sensor Data Mining) dataset includes raw time-series data collected from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors of a smartphone and smartwatch with their corresponding labels for each activity. The sensor data was collected at a rate of 20 Hz (i.e., every 50ms). Weiss et.al., collected this dataset from 51 subjects who performed 18 different activities listed in Table 2, each for 3 minutes, while having the smartphone in their right pant pocket and wearing the smartwatch in their dominant hand. Each line of the time-series sensor file is considered as input.
