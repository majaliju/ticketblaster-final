  <em>One day, I asked myself: "what if Ticketmaster and Craigslist had a baby?"</em>

  For buying tickets, TicketMaster (and as a consequence, its parent company Live Nation) is pretty much the dominant source. 
  
  However they're famous for a lot of horrible business practices that hurt the consumer in many ways, among which include: exorbitant service fees, artificial control of ticket capacity, and discriminatory practices against musical artists based on secret relationships with venues/labels, etc. 

  <p align="center"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/R6jF0XH.png" alt="New York Times headline.gif" display="inline-block" width="60%" height="50%"/></p>

  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/18/technology/live-nation-ticketmaster-investigation-taylor-swift.html">It's gotten so bad that even the US Justice Department had to step in recently. </a>
  
  As a musician and programmer both, I took it upon myself to create an alternative to the ticket-buying process!

  With TICKETBLASTER, you can buy directly from other fans or sell directly to other fans. We have the entire database of concerts and artists, and all you have to do is either create a post to sell tickets or check out posts to find tickets. Apart from that, we hold no money or handle any deals for you. We have only one job: to help fans buy and sell tickets to see artists and bands perform live, without paying horrible service fees and getting F'd over. 

  As a musician first, I want everybody to experience the communal, mystic power of music surrounded by other people <strong >without</strong> the greedy hand of business perverting yet another wonderful facet of this human experience we enjoy daily.

<p align="justify"> 
  Just make an account, and scroll through to find your favorite artists and their shows! 
  
  Click the Artists tab if you want to see more about a specific artist, or go to the Concerts tab to look directly for shows! 
  <!-- CREATE A GIF OF ME USING THE ARTISTS TAB AND CONCERTS TAB HERE -->
  <!-- <img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/R6jF0XH.png" alt="New York Times headline.gif" display="inline-block" width="60%" height="50%"/>
  -->
  
  You can also search (case-insensitive) by venue name (ex. "MSG" or "mSg" or "SoFi Stadium"), by artist name (ex. "adele" or "john legend"), and even by date in the YYYY-MM-DD format! It's super easy to use!

  My goal is to get you in and out, and help you buy/sell your tickets fast! 
  
  Why spend time on a website when you should spend it listening to music??
