NOTES FROM NANCY

— dont send all users (remove any state with /users in it)
— backend is just sending back the LOGGED IN user (/me) and thats it— remove the individual feature for the users stuff and simplify the app
— no need for a session index, or or even for users — session just has create; users just has show and create
— then serialize it properly
— all info is being handled backend and then is being sent to the frontend, very simply. no need for any excess work
