CHALLENGE WITH BEN

Create a custom route that takes a parameter of a single word. That route should take us to an action where we look through posts to see if any of the posts have that word in the content (doesnâ€™t have to be a full match, case-insensitive). The action will render json of all the users that have matching posts. If there is no match render json that says so.
